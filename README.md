# Avr-Reservation-UI
This project intends to lay out an interface for reserving and tracking spots in a parking lot using AVR microcontrollers. 
The project also includes interrupts related to PIR sensors to detect cars and offer them service as soon as possible.  
Repository contains Proteus simulation files and the source code.
In order to do the simulation use the .hex code in "codes, alpha" folder.

What you can find in this project that may help you:
1. interfacing a keypad
2. interfacing an lcd
3. atmega32 interrupt set up
4. atmega32 RTC set up (Real-time clock)
